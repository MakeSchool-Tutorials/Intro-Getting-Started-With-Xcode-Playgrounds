> Xcode 8 and Swift 3 was released on September 13th, 2016. Please make sure to update as soon as possible. Follow the instructions below for checking your version and updating if necessary. Switching to Xcode 8 and Swift 3 will allow you to have the best experience in this course.

This tutorial will guide you through installing Xcode and get you started on your iOS developer journey. You'll be learning the newest version of Swift, _Swift 3_ throughout your journey.

You should be on OS X El Capitan (10.11.6 or higher) and have Xcode 8.0+. If you are *absolutely* positive you have these, go ahead on to the next page.

Let's get our tools set up.

# Checking OS X

Press the üçé button on the top left of your Mac screen and click `About this Mac`. It should say `OS X El Capitan` and `Version 10.11.6` (or higher). If it does not say `OS X El Capitan`, go [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117?mt=12) and install El Capitan.

If it does not say `Version 10.11.6` (or higher) but _does_ say `OS X El Capitan`, press the üçé button on the top left of your Mac screen and click `App Store`. Install the updates!

# Installing Xcode

Go to the Mac App Store to download [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (our integrated development environment or IDE). Make sure you are using the most up to date version from the App Store (not developer preview versions). Drag Xcode onto your dock from your Applications folder so that you can easily access it.
